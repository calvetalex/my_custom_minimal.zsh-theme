# my_custom_minimal.zsh-theme
Custom minimal theme for zsh. 

Original theme: https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/minimal.zsh-theme

Git handling theme: https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/mortalscumbag.zsh-theme

## What did I add ?
Shape color is now depending on the value returned by the last command.The time it took to execute is displayed on the right in cyan

From mortalscumbag theme, I imported git prompt handling. I add a custom prompt with a separator and the number of
files for each category: staged, unstaged, untracked and unmerged. Morevover, I used spectrum colors (to see them,
enter "spectrum_ls" in a terminal, and to use them use $FG[]).
